This is a basic implementation of a command line based snake game. The snake head is represented by the & character while the rest of the body is represented by # character. Food is represented by o character.

To run, clone the project using: git clone https://github.com/gkaps/skycoin_snake_game_golang.git

In the cloned project folder, run the game using: ./game for Mac or Linux or game for Windows

You can pass specify board size by passing command line arguments for height and width. E.g. to specify 20 by 30: game 20 30

After running, the controls to play are presented on the right side of the board.

W - up | S - down | A - left | D - right and hit enter (case insensitive). If you hit enter without choosing or choosing other character, snake continues on current direction Running into a wall or into snake body results in Game Over

This task took me 3 days, working 2-4 hrs a day to complete.
